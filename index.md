# Introduction

## Preface

This is a place for notes on anything of interest to me, or related to my work. I plan to keep expanding and updating these notes as my K-Base expands. While these notes are heavily IT and developer focused, I may occasionally keep notes on other topics.

If you spot a typo or anything else please submit an issue at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aaatipamula-work/notes)

> **NOTE**: While I plan to keep most of these pages as up to date as possible, ones that haven't been updated in a while may have broken links.
