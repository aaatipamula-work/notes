# LaTeX

## Overview

[LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) is a somewhat markup language that is used to prepare documents and more importantly for my use can be used to write mathematical and physics equations in plaintext. This allows for documents to be written in a much easier to type format that is fairly readable in plaintext, while also maintaining the readability of mathematical expressions when formatted.

## Syntax

**Note**: The syntax for LaTeX is very *very* extensive and I could not begin to write out everything that it offers. Entire documents can be written in LaTeX which can specify formatting etc. However the following are bits that I use often when using LaTeX in my [markdown](./markdown.md) notes:

| Symbol/Operation | Syntax |
| --- | --- | 
| *Grouping | `{}`
| Super Script | `^` |
| Sub Script | `_` |
| Multiplication | `*` |
| Addition | `+` |
| Subtraction | `-` |
| Division/Fraction | `/` |
| Plus Minus | `\pm` |
| Integral | `\int` |
| Summation | `\sum` |
| Pi | `\pi` |
| Greek Delta | `\Delta` |
| Infinity | `\inf` |
| Sine | `\sin` |
| Cosine | `\cos` |
| Tangent | `\tan` |
| Cotangent | `\cot` |
| Secant | `\sec` |
| Cosecant | `\csc`
| Arc Sine | `\arcsin` |
| Arc Cosine | `\arccos` |
| Arc Tangent | `\arctan` |
| Arc Cotangent | `\arccot` |
| Arc Secant | `\arcsec` |
| Arc Secant | `\arcsec` |

> *NOTE: Groupings can be nested and put after an operation to specify that they belong to that operation 
>
> e.g. `x^{3ex}` would put the `3ex` in the exponent.
