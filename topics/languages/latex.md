# LaTeX

## Overview

[LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) is a somewhat markup language that is used to prepare documents and more importantly for my use can be used to write mathematical and physics equations in plaintext. This allows for documents to be written in a much easier to type format, while maintaining the formatting and readability of mathematical expressions.

## Syntax

**Note**: The syntax for LaTeX is very *very* extensive and I could not begin to write out everything that it offers. However the following are bits that I use often.

| Object | Syntax |
| --- | --- | 
| Grouping | `{}`
| Super Script | `^` |
| Sub Script | `_` |
| Multiplication | `*` |
| Addition | `+` |
| Subtraction | `-` |
| Division/Fraction | `/` |
| Plus Minus | `\pm` |
| Integral | `\int` |
| Summation | `\sum` |
| Pi | `\pi` |
| Greek Delta | `\Delta` |
| Infinity | `\inf` |
| Sine | `\sin` |
| Cosine | `\cos` |
| Tangent | `\tan` |
| Cotangent | `\cot` |
| Secant | `\sec` |
| Cosecant | `\csc`
| Arc Sine | `\arcsin` |
| Arc Cosine | `\arccos` |
| Arc Tangent | `\arctan` |
| Arc Cotangent | `\arccot` |
| Arc Secant | `\arcsec` |
| Arc Secant | `\arcsec` |
