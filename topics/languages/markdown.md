# Markdown

*Section on markdown engines and more syntax to be added*

## Overview

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is (ironically) a markup language that simplifies creating formatted text. It aims to be easy to read in both formatted and plaintext versions. It is highly useful when creating easy to read documents that have hyperlinks and references, like these notes!

## Syntax

**Note**: Although simple to learn, markdown syntax can be complicated to follow as there is a largely been a lack of standardization in markdown parsing engines. The past few years (July 2023 curr. date) have seen more standardization, but there are still many different variations between engines. 

Common Syntax:

| Element | Syntax |
| --- | --- | 
| Headings | # for heading 1 or ## for heading 2 |
| Bold | \*\*bold\*\* |
| Italicized | \*italicized\* |
| Ordered List | 1. one 2. two  |
| Unordered List | - one - two  |
| Code | \`code\` |
| Horizontal Rule | --- |
| Link | \[link\](https://www.example.com/) |
| Image | !\[image\](https://www.example.com/) |

**Note** Most engines support replacing URLs with local files on links an images. For *Links* some even support putting header names in the URL section.
> e.g. \[image\](./image.png)

> e.g. \[link\](#heading1)
