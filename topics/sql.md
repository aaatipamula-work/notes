# SQL

## Resources 

I would suggest going through the following lessons to get a decent understanding of SQL and its use:

- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql) 
  - [SQL Basics](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql#sql-basics)
  - [More Advanced SQL Queries](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql#more-advanced-sql-queries)
  - [Relational Queries](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql#modifying-databases-with-sql)
- [W3 Schools Tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp)
  - This has an extensive list of pretty much every SQL feature you might use.
  - *It is mostly useful when you just want a short document that goes over a feature or topic*.
  - **I would check out the [Views](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_view.asp) page to get familiar with them, we are currently using Views to feed the AI**.

## Reference

- [W3 Schools Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_ref_keywords.asp)
  - Great for checking if you're using something correctly.
  - Has a pretty extensive list of everything you might ever use in SQL.

## Databases

### MSSQL (Microsoft SQL Server)

[MSSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server) or Microsoft SQL Server.

*MSSQL* uses a superset of SQL called [T-SQL](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/sql-tutorial/transact-sql) or Transact SQL.

> Being a superset of SQL it functions similarly at its core and anything you've already learned about SQL should apply. 
> The only statement I've found that does not work is the `LIKE` statement.

*I suggest downloading [SSMS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16) or SQL Server Management Studio to interact with databases*.
